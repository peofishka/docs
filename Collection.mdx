## Pablo Picasso

Pablo Picasso, a towering figure in 20th-century art, is celebrated for his revolutionary approach and as the co-founder of Cubism. His genius lay in his ability to continuously reinvent his style, pushing the boundaries of art and leaving a lasting impact on the world. Drawing inspiration from African and Iberian art, Picasso also made significant contributions to Surrealism and Expressionism. Throughout his prolific career, he created over 20,000 works, and one of his most notable paintings, “Les Femmes d’Alger,” fetched a staggering $179.3 million at Christie’s in 2015.

This masterpiece, painted during the Spanish Civil War, captures Picasso’s lover and muse, Dora Maar. In this work, Picasso deconstructs and reimagines Maar’s form, revealing layers of emotion and historical context. The portrait, with its angular lines and fragmented shapes, is a striking example of Picasso’s Cubist style. This painting, estimated at €25 million, reflects the intense and turbulent relationship between Picasso and Maar, set against the backdrop of a war-torn era. It’s a powerful reminder of how personal and historical events intertwine in art.

Created in 1962, this linocut print is Picasso’s unique take on the traditional still-life format. The process involved carving a design onto linoleum, inking it, and pressing it onto paper. This print demonstrates Picasso’s talent for bringing everyday objects to life with dynamic energy. With only 50 known prints in existence, one signed piece sold for between $480,000 and $720,000 in 2017, highlighting the rarity and desirability of his works. This piece is a testament to Picasso’s ability to innovate and master various artistic techniques, making even the simplest subjects extraordinary.


# Salvador Dalí

Born in 1904 in Figueres, Spain, Salvador Dalí is renowned for his precision in depicting the bizarre and fantastic. A true Renaissance man, Dalí excelled in various forms of art, including sculpture, filmmaking, writing, and stage design. His boundless creativity and unique vision made him a leading figure in the Surrealist movement. Dalí’s work, characterized by dreamlike imagery and meticulous detail, continues to captivate and inspire. Dalí’s work remains highly sought after, with “Portrait de Paul Éluard” selling for $21.74 million at Sotheby’s in 2011.

Translated as “Untitled (Man-Tree with a Flayed Heart),” this painting, depicting a tree-like figure with human features, merges humanity with nature, symbolizing our intrinsic connection to the world around us. The flayed heart, a powerful symbol of human suffering, highlights the vulnerability and pain we carry within us. This striking piece, with its surreal blend of the organic and the human, invites viewers to reflect on the deep emotional and existential themes that Dalí masterfully explores. 

# Gus Van Sant

While best known as a filmmaker, Gus Van Sant’s paintings provide an intimate exploration of emotions. His experience in visual storytelling shines through in his use of watercolors to create dreamlike and melancholic scenes. These artworks often reflect the themes of alienation and loneliness, offering a deeper glimpse into his creative mind. Van Sant’s ability to convey raw emotion through his paintings has earned him admiration from both art lovers and cinephiles, proving his versatility as an artist.

“Mona Lisa #11” is a modern reinterpretation of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, employing gold leaf, crayon, and oil paint to craft a textured, visually striking image. This piece opens a dialogue between the past and present, enriching its significance within the broader context of art history, inviting viewers to see the iconic Mona Lisa in a new light.


# Andy Warhol

The king of Pop Art, Andy Warhol, blurred the lines between high art and popular culture in a way that no one else had done before. His innovative approach and distinctive style made him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Warhol was not just a painter – he was a true multimedia pioneer, dabbling in photography, filmmaking, and music production. Warhol’s “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” sold for a staggering $195 million in 2022, making it the most expensive 20th-century work of art sold at auction.

Warhol’s “Campbell’s Soup Cans” series changed the way we look at art by turning everyday objects into something extraordinary. “Campbell’s Soup/Scott Broth F & S II.49” is one of the gems in our collection, showcasing Warhol’s talent for making the mundane captivating. This piece features a vibrant, detailed depiction of the familiar soup can, inviting viewers to see the beauty in the ordinary. It’s a perfect example of Warhol’s critique of artistic elitism and his celebration of everyday life. 


# Banksy

The enigmatic street artist Banksy is renowned for his provocative stencil graffiti that blends social commentary with dark humor. His works address themes of war, consumerism, and social inequality, often sparking debate and discussion. Banksy’s ability to capture the spirit of time with a single image has made him a cultural icon. One of his most famous pieces, “Love is in the Bin,” sold for $25.4 million, marking it as his most expensive work to date. His talent for transforming public spaces into thought-provoking art has cemented his status as a revolutionary figure in contemporary art.

## Turf War

<img height="200" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdMsQ6VhiPuTpNbyzpxHOWrKs32w9koYQFZNnh2o5ZUsx3oPcE1r3IwMZxNllGavrZy4mtPWSURf5GCmfMwKzCYmoWjpOcy-YaGZs3bDCT5E5Dnsao2IzE6dLo7nD1CJfbklmb91cEK2gRAPUL_7oVlhAE?key=4PEE7uTCNQskFQQ2TSf0MQ" />

In 2003, Banksy’s first major exhibition, “Turf War,” turned heads by featuring live animals as part of the artwork. The event included pigs painted in police colors, a cow adorned with Andy Warhol’s face, and a portrait of Churchill with a green mohawk, among other provocative exhibits. “Turf War” was a bold challenge to conventional art, combining humor with social critique and skyrocketing Banksy from street artist to international icon. The painting “Turf War” itself, created for this groundbreaking exhibition, challenges perceptions of authority. It pays homage to the iconic ‘Roaring Lion’ portrait of Winston Churchill but adds a rebelios twist – a bright green mohawk.

## Choose Your Weapon (Gold) VIP

<img height="200" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcqIzBCILxxMn2NN2ToKTMH46eSKV51QI68-z8OmYey2omzCDoPDbK4lcRse2QXI1gLMl3HA6uNTvpUUuLZqFCzJli1aI1fLPJfkTBQfZ3WYqUJJShNdpnbbxE7PGY-yDcDMpljR-VF8_1SKDrHpeILkh1W?key=4PEE7uTCNQskFQQ2TSf0MQ" />

This screen print, paying homage to Keith Haring, uses a metallic sheen to add an element of exclusivity. Limited to a select group of collectors, “Choose Your Weapon (Gold) VIP” explores alternatives to violence through its powerful imagery.
