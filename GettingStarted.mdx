# Introduction

[10101.art](https://10101.art) is a groundbreaking ecosystem bridging the traditional art market with the digital age. On our platform, you can become **a real owner of original physical masterpieces**, including works by **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.

Each artwork is digitally divided into shares using blockchain technology. Owners of these shares acquire legal ownership of the corresponding part of the artwork. 

If one owner collects all parts, they can claim the physical painting from the [offline gallery in Dubai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AEAhUseLEvLW5CJA6).



## How does it all work?

**Real World Assets (RWA)** are any tangible or intangible objects existing in the real world, such as **physical paintings** and other items. 
These assets can undergo a **tokenization process**, resulting in **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens). 
NFTs utilize blockchain technology to provide proof of ownership and authenticity for each specific asset.

**The process** not only **enables ownership** and **enhances liquidity** in traditionally illiquid markets but also **simplifies purchasing**, **selling**, **exchanging**, and **transferring** these assets to others.

Thanks to this technology, **every transaction is transparent and immutable**; no one can forge or delete the ownership record.



## Our mission

We believe in democratizing art ownership and access. By leveraging technology, we want to **break down barriers** and empower individuals worldwide to engage with and own authentic artworks, fostering a **more inclusive and participatory art community**.

Our goal is to **change the global art market**, making it **reachable** to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where **anyone can join the art**, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development. This **allows anyone to own original physical masterpieces** by artists like **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.
