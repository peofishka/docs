# Introduction

[10101.art](https://10101.art) is a groundbreaking ecosystem bridging the traditional art market with the digital age. On our platform, you can become **a real owner of original physical masterpieces**, including works by **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.

Each artwork is digitally divided into shares using blockchain technology. Owners of these shares acquire legal ownership of the corresponding part of the artwork. 

If one owner collects all parts, they can claim the physical painting from the [offline gallery in Dubai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AEAhUseLEvLW5CJA6).



## How It Works

Any tangible or intangible item can be tokenized and transformed into a certificate that grants ownership and control over the item in real life. Such items are referred to as **Real World Assets (RWA)**, and the ownership certificates are termed **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**.

Sometimes it can be difficult to buy assets in the real world due to low liquidity, authenticity verification challenges, or high entry barriers into specific markets.

### Why buy a whole painting when you can purchase just a few centimeters?

We've devised a method where **anyone can enter the art market** without requiring substantial capital.
Any items can undergo a **tokenization process**, resulting in **NFTs**, and they **cannot be altered or falsified**, because every transaction is transparent and immutable**; no one can forge or delete the ownership record.

**Thus, the process** not only **enables ownership** and **enhances liquidity** in traditionally illiquid markets but also **simplifies purchasing**, **selling**, **exchanging**, and **transferring** these items to others.

Moreover, **by dividing assets into parts, we make it more accessible** for individuals to participate in the market. This partitional ownership approach lowers the barrier to entry, allowing more people to purchase and enjoy prestigious assets.



## Our mission

We believe in democratizing art ownership and access. By leveraging technology, we want to **empower** individuals worldwide to engage with and own authentic artworks, fostering a **more inclusive and participatory art community**.

Our goal is to **change the global art market**, making it **reachable** to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where **anyone can join the art**, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development. This **allows anyone to own original physical masterpieces** by artists like **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.
