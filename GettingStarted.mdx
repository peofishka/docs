## Introduction

[10101.art](https://10101.art) is a groundbreaking ecosystem bridging the traditional art market with the digital age. On our platform, you can become **a real owner of original physical masterpieces**, including works by **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.

Each artwork is digitally divided into shares using blockchain technology. Owners of these shares acquire legal ownership of the corresponding part of the artwork. 

If one owner collects all parts, they can claim the physical painting from the [offline gallery in Dubai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AEAhUseLEvLW5CJA6).



## What are RWA & NFT?

**Real World Assets (RWA)** are any tangible or intangible objects existing in the real world, such as physical paintings and other items. 
These items can undergo a tokenization process, resulting in **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens).

These NFTs are a blockchain technology that **provides proof of ownership and authenticity** for each specific asset. This process enables ownership and enhances liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets.

Thanks to these technologies, **every transaction is transparent and immutable**; no one can forge or delete the ownership record.



## Our mission

Our goal is to revolutionize the global art market, making it reachable to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where anyone can join the art, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development.
