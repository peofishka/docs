# Introduction

[10101.art](https://10101.art) is a groundbreaking ecosystem bridging the traditional art market with the digital age. On our platform, you can become **a real owner of original physical masterpieces**, including works by **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.

Each artwork is digitally divided into shares using blockchain technology. Owners of these shares acquire legal ownership of the corresponding part of the artwork. 

If one owner collects all parts, they can claim the physical painting from the [offline gallery in Dubai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AEAhUseLEvLW5CJA6).



## How does it all work?

Any tangible or intangible item can be tokenized and transformed into a certificate that grants ownership and control over the item in real life. These items are referred to as **Real World Assets (RWA)**, and the ownership certificates are termed **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**.

Through a tokenization process, items are converted into NFTs, which **cannot be altered or falsified**. This process not only **enables ownership** and **enhances liquidity** in traditionally illiquid markets but also simplifies purchasing, selling, exchanging, and transferring these items to others.

However, purchasing exclusive assets can sometimes be challenging **due to high entry barriers into specific markets**.

### Why buy a whole painting when you can buy just a few centimeters?

We've developed a method where **anyone can enter the art market** without needing substantial capital.

**Now**, through the tokenization and division of paintings into parts, **we make participation more accessible**. This approach lowers the barrier to entry, allowing more people to purchase and enjoy prestigious assets!

## Our mission

We believe in democratizing art ownership and access. By leveraging technology, we want to **break down barriers** and empower individuals worldwide to engage with and own authentic artworks, fostering a **more inclusive and participatory art community**.

Our goal is to **change the global art market**, making it **reachable** to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where **anyone can join the art**, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development. This **allows anyone to own original physical masterpieces** by artists like **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.
