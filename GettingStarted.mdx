## Introduction

## What are RWA & NFT?

RWAs, or Real World Assets, are tangible or intangible assets tokenized as NFTs, enabling ownership and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets through blockchain technology.

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a type of digital token that is stored on a blockchain and serves as proof of ownership and authenticity for a specific digital or physical asset.
