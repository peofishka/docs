## Introduction

[10101.art](https://10101.art) is a groundbreaking ecosystem bridging the traditional art market with the digital age. On our platform, you can become **a real owner of original physical masterpieces**, including works by **Picasso**, **Dali**, **Warhol**, **Banksy**, and more.

Each artwork is digitally divided into shares using blockchain technology (Ethereum). Owners of these shares acquire legal ownership of the corresponding part of the artwork. 

If one owner collects all parts, they can claim the physical painting from the [offline gallery in Dubai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AEAhUseLEvLW5CJA6).



## What are RWA & NFT?

RWAs, or Real World Assets, are tangible or intangible assets tokenized as NFTs, enabling ownership and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets through blockchain technology.

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a type of digital token that is stored on a blockchain and serves as proof of ownership and authenticity for a specific digital or physical asset.

## Our mission

Our goal is to revolutionize the global art market, making it reachable to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where anyone can join the art, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development.
