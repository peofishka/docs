# General Questions


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is 10101 Marketplace?">
10101 Marketplace is a platform that bridges traditional art with the digital era by offering co-ownership of real-world art assets through blockchain technology and NFTs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are NFTs on 10101.art?">
It is a blockchain certificate that confirms co-ownership of the physical painting by those who hold it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What blockchain do we use?">
Currently our platform operates on Ethereum blockchain. But we also plan to launch some collections using other blockchains, like Polygon, in the near future.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the platform function?">
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
Our artexperts select exclusive paintings from top collectors, auction houses, and galleries. Check all the documents for the authenticity of the work of art.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Next, the projectâ€™s top management decides whether the painting will be presented on 10101.art. If so, we organize the transportation of the painting to Dubai. Create digital representations of it using high-end scanning equipment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
Our skilled developers digitalize the artwork fragments into NFT-tokens. Launch the primary sale using NFT technology, with or without a whitelist.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Fourth Step">
With 100% sale of the painting within the time limit, NFTs become available for further transactions.

# Rights, Usage, and Refunds
