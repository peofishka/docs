The journey of [10101.art](https://10101.art) began in early 2022. Our founder, [Irina Garasymiv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-garasymiv-691874179/), saw the emerging interest in blockchain technologies and **Real World Asset (RWAs) tokenization** not just as a passing trend, but as **a foundation for a new chapter in art ownership**. She envisioned moving beyond the traditional, individual ownership of art to a shared experience made possible and secure through blockchain.

This vision is built on blockchain and RWA tokenization’s **unique ability to enable collective ownership seamlessly and securely**. In the context of [10101.art](https://10101.art), blockchain acts as a transparent digital ledger, recording every transaction. This means when you purchase a token representing part of an artwork, that transaction is permanently recorded. Your ownership of the art piece is secure and transparent, bringing a level of trust to collective ownership **that was once hard to come by**.

Furthermore, our specific use of RWA tokenization divides a physical artwork into digital tokens, **each representing a partial ownership of an original artwork itself**. Smart contracts on the blockchain detail and automate the specifics of this ownership, clarifying and ensuring each token’s holder gets a fair deal.

By integrating these technologies, [10101.art](https://10101.art) **tears down the usual barriers to art ownership**, such as high costs or the need for exclusive access. They make it possible for anyone to buy, sell, and own art collectively, securely, and transparently. 

>‘By democratizing access to art, we ensure that beauty and culture can be shared by all, not just held by a few. It’s about making legendary art reachable for everyone to enjoy,’ – says Irina, and that is what 10101.art’s mission is all about.
