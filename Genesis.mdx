The journey of [10101.art](https://10101.art) began in early 2022. Our founder, [Irina Garasymiv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-garasymiv-691874179/), saw the emerging interest in blockchain technologies and **Real World Asset (RWAs) tokenization** not just as a passing trend, but as **a foundation for a new chapter in art ownership**. She envisioned moving beyond the traditional, individual ownership of art to a shared experience made possible and secure through blockchain.
