## Introduction

10101.art is a platform that bridges the classic art world with the modern digital era. Here, you can become the owner of original masterpieces by renowned artists such as Picasso, Dali, Warhol, and many others.

We offer co-ownership of Real World Assets through blockchain technology (NFTs), providing a seamless way to own parts of physical artworks.


## What are RWA & NFT?

RWAs, or Real World Assets, are tangible or intangible assets tokenized as NFTs, enabling ownership and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets through blockchain technology.

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a type of digital token that is stored on a blockchain and serves as proof of ownership and authenticity for a specific digital or physical asset.

## Our mission

Our goal is to revolutionize the global art market, making it reachable to many around the world. 
We aim to create an environment where anyone can join the art, acquiring authentic artworks, engaging with them and influencing their development.
