Setting up and managing your account on [10101.art](https://10101.art) is a straightforward process. 
Follow these steps to ensure your profile is secure and ready to engage with our platform.

## Pre-Setup

Before you begin, you'll need to set up a digital wallet to interact with our platform. We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a secure and popular wallet for managing your assets. Alternatively, you can use other wallets supported by [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/).
