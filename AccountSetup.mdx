Setting up and managing your account on [10101.art](https://10101.art) is a straightforward process. 
Follow these steps to ensure your profile is secure and ready to engage with our platform.

## Pre-Setup

Before you begin, you'll need to set up a digital wallet to interact with our platform. We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a secure and popular wallet for managing your digital assets. Alternatively, you can use other wallets supported by [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/).




  <Accordion title="Install MetaMask">
### Install MetaMask:

Visit the MetaMask website and download the extension for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge) or download the MetaMask app for your mobile device.
Follow the installation instructions and add the extension to your browser or install the app on your phone.
### Create a Wallet:

Open MetaMask and click on "Get Started."
Select "Create a Wallet" and follow the prompts to set up a new wallet.
Important: Save your seed phrase (a series of 12 or 24 words) in a secure location. This phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your device. Do not share your seed phrase with anyone.
